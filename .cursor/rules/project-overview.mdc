# CardVault - Android Wallet App Overview

## Project Identity
CardVault is an **offline-first Android application** for managing digital cards (credit, debit, gift cards, vouchers, memberships). The app serves as a secure digital repository for physical cards with complete data locality.

## Core Principles (CRITICAL - NEVER VIOLATE)
- **100% Offline Operation**: NEVER add network permissions, cloud APIs, or remote dependencies
- **Privacy First**: No analytics, tracking, or data collection - reject any third-party telemetry
- **Premium Experience**: All animations must target 60fps with smooth Material Design 3 transitions
- **Local Storage Only**: All data stays on device in Room database and app's private storage
- **Security**: Use Google Tink for encryption, sandboxed storage for all files

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin 100% (No Java code)
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)
- **DI**: Hilt (`@HiltAndroidApp`, `@AndroidEntryPoint`, `@HiltViewModel`)
- **Navigation**: Compose Navigation with kotlinx.serialization for type-safe arguments
- **Database**: Room with KSP annotation processing
- **Camera**: CameraX for lifecycle-aware camera implementation
- **ML**: Google ML Kit Text Recognition for offline OCR
- **Images**: Coil for loading, caching, and transformations

## Build Configuration
- **Target SDK**: API 36 (Android 15)
- **Min SDK**: API 29 (Android 10)
- **Java Version**: 11
- **Build System**: Gradle Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`)

## Card Workflows

### Textual Cards (Credit/Debit ONLY)
1. User selects Credit or Debit card type
2. Camera captures front and back images
3. ML Kit OCR extracts: card number, expiry date, CVV, cardholder name
4. User reviews and edits extracted data
5. System generates gradient card design for sharing
6. Images stored, card saved to database

### Image-Only Cards (All Other Types)
1. User selects card type (Gift, Voucher, Membership, Transport, etc.)
2. Camera captures front and back images
3. **NO OCR processing** - pure image storage
4. User adds custom fields if needed
5. Images stored as-is for sharing
6. Card saved to database

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Don't add network permissions or cloud APIs
- ❌ Don't use SharedPreferences - use Proto DataStore
- ❌ Don't block main thread - always use coroutines for I/O
- ❌ Don't expose mutable state from ViewModels
- ❌ Don't run OCR on non-Credit/Debit cards
- ❌ Don't forget to clean up images when deleting cards
- ❌ Don't put business logic in composables or repositories
